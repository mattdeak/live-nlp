Live Analysis of Online Forums

Currently targetting Reddit Submissions and Subreddits.

The goal of this project is to be a suite to analyze and visualize NLP metrics as they arise in the context of online forums over time.
In the early stages for prototyping, reddit is the primary target, but this will eventually be extensible to a wider variety of online content.
